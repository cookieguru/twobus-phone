<!--
This file contains overrides for agency-related data returned by the One Bus Away API
This file, and each XML element, is optional, allowing you to only specify the parameters you need

The most useful element is likely the <Order/> parameter.  For example, if the API for your region
returns three transit agencies, and you always want agency ID 12 to be read in the prompts before
the other agencies, add <Order>1</Order> for <agency id="12">
Additional agencies will be read in the order returned by the API.  Duplicates will cause only the
last defined agency to take the given sort spot

	<!-- The ID is the string returned by the agencies-with-coverage call -->
	<agency id="">

		<!-- Name that will be spoken when referring to this agency -->
		<!-- Useful if the API returns a long name and customers know the agency by an acronym -->
