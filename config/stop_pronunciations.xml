This file contains pronunciation overrides for transit stops.  This file is optional.
Stop pronunciations are NOT case sensitive work best WITH surrounding whitespace, 
so strings within words do not get replaced (e.g. "Ave" to "Avenue" would turn "Maven" 
to "Mavenue").
These are loaded after the default substitutions are loaded, enabling you to override 
the built-in pronunciations.
