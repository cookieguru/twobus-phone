This file contains pronunciation overrides for trip headsigns.  This file is optional.
Stop pronunciations are NOT case sensitive work best WITHOUT surrounding whitespace, 
since these replacements may or may not have commas.  In some cases, it may be 
necessary to add surrounding whitespace (e.g. so "Ave" to "Avenue" would not turn
"Maven" to "Mavenue").
